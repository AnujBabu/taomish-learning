The closing tag is the same tag as the opening tag, preceded by a slash.
written using angle brackets (< and >).

Some omitted closing tags cause bigger issues: not closing some tags, such as <script>, <style>, <template>, <textarea>, and <title>, breaks subsequent content

* section tag: The <section> tag in HTML is used to define a standalone section or block of content within an HTML document. Its primary role is to group related content together and provide semantic meaning to that particular section

* body is about all the things that are shown in an page

*attributes:
<img> and <input> examples had more than just the element type in their opening tag. These extra bits of space-separated name/value pairs (though sometimes including a value is optional) are called attributes.
attr comes i=only in the opening tab
eg:  <a href="http://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>

define the behavior, linkages, and functionality of elements.
eg: <img src="switch.svg" alt="light switch" ismap />
src, alt and ismap is attr of image tag
HTML is not case-sensitive, but some attribute values are.
* metadata viewport:
The other meta tag that should be considered essential is the viewport meta tag, which helps site responsiveness, enabling content to render well by default, no matter the viewport width. While the viewport meta tag has been around since June 2007, when the first iPhone came out, it's only recently been documented in a specification. As it enables controlling a viewport's size and scale, and prevents the site's content from being sized down to fit a 960px site onto a 320px screen, it is definitely recommended.
