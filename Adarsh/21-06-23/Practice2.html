     <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee plant123. 
        The coffee plant is a tropical evergreen shrub that originated in Africa and Asia, but is now grown in many regions
         of the world13. Coffee is one of the most popular and profitable drinks in the world, with a dark, bitter, 
         and slightly acidic flavor and a stimulating effect due to its caffeine content12. There are many official words
        and categories to describe the aroma, body, roast, and taste of coffee4.</p>
